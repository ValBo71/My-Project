## ⚙️ Configuration

Configurations can be changed in [appsettings.json](file:///E:/Programing/My_project/GitHub/MyProject/08.Playwright/4.Automation%20at%20automationexercise.com/AutomationExercise.Tests/Config/appsettings.json):

```json
{
  "TestSettings": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://automationexercise.com",
    "Browser": "Chromium",
    "Headless": false,
    "TimeoutSeconds": 30,
    "SlowMoMs": 500
  }
}
```

* **`Headless`**: Set to `true` to run tests silently in the background, or `false` to see the browser window.
* **`SlowMoMs`**: Adds a delay in milliseconds between actions. Set to `500` to easily observe button clicks and typing actions visually.

## 🚀 Running the Tests

Ensure you have the [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

### 1. Restore & Build the project
```bash
dotnet build
```

### 2. Run the complete suite
```bash
dotnet test
```

### 3. Run specific test case(s)
To run a specific test by name:
```bash
dotnet test --filter "Name~PlaceOrder_RegisterWhileCheckout"
```

---

## 📊 Allure Reporting

The test suite generates Allure-compatible XML/JSON results automatically on execution.

### Prerequisites
Install the Allure command-line tool globally via npm:
```bash
npm install -g allure-commandline
```

### Generate & View Report

1. Navigate to the compilation output folder:
   ```bash
   cd AutomationExercise.Tests/bin/Debug/net9.0
   ```

2. Compile the XML results into an HTML report:
   ```bash
   allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
   ```

3. Start a local server to view the dashboard in your browser:
   ```bash
   allure open allure-report
   ```
